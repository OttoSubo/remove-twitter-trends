## ðŸ’» Installation (Chrome)
1. [Download ZIP](https://github.com/OttoSubo/remove-twitter-trends/archive/main.zip)
2. Unzip anywhere
3. Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Toggle **"Developer mode"** ON (top-right)
5. Click **"Load unpacked"**
6. Select the unzipped folder

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
This removes:
- "Trending now" sections
- Premium subscription nagging

```javascript
// Basically finds and deletes stuff
document.querySelectorAll('.annoying-class').forEach(el => el.remove());
```

## ðŸ¤· Why Bother?
I just wanted my feed clean and i couldnt find any addons for it so i made this and wanted to share. Made this with:
- 0% Google
- 100% DeepSeek AI
- 0% actual coding skills
