#Twitter/X Cleanup

> **Disclaimer**: I literally made this in 5 minutes using DeepSeek's AI. I don't know web development. Use at your own risk. No updates/support planned.

## ðŸ’» Installation (Chrome)
1. [Download ZIP](https://github.com/YOURNAME/remove-twitter-trends/archive/main.zip)
2. Unzip anywhere
3. Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Toggle **"Developer mode"** ON (top-right)
5. Click **"Load unpacked"**
6. Select the unzipped folder

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
This removes:
- "Trending now" sections
- Premium subscription nagging
- Other annoying Twitter/X stuff

```javascript
// Basically finds and deletes stuff
document.querySelectorAll('.annoying-class').forEach(el => el.remove());
```
